//10ICT Instructions
//Currently this is a game that lets the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.
//If they guessed correctly, it will print out that they have gussed correctly.
//Otherwise it will print out that they're wrong.

//TODO:
//If they are wrong, it would be nice if we gave them a hint, such as the number to guess is larger or smaller than the user's guess.
//If they are wrong, we could decrement the number of guesses they have left, so it makes it a bit more challenging (adjust the variable numberOfGuesses).
//If they are correct, you could tell them how many tries it took to guess correctly.
//If they are correct, you could congratulate them and restart the game, with a new number and reset the variable back to 20
//If they are wrong, is there any other hints we could give the user that's not higher or lower?

var toGuess = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;  
var numberOfGuesses = 20;

	var inputNum = document.getElementById("num").value;//the number the user inputs to guess
	//The following is a demo to show the use of input statements
	//you may remove this as you work on the programme
	
	var always = true;//now, this is a third type a variable can take, it is called a boolean. They can be true or false;
	
	console.log(toGuess);//this let's us see the solution in the console, but will prevent the user from seeing it!
	
	if(always==true){
		//I am always executed :)
		console.log("we have reached here when always is true");
	}
	if(always==false){
		console.log("I can put anything here since nobody will ever see it!!");
